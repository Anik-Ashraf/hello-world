There is no fun in giving up
Being a marketing student I felt it necessary to have some basic programming skills. Programming skill is a must to survive in the era of big data. Currently, I am in my senior year and hopefully, I will be graduating after 8 months. I want to utlize each bit of the time. Thank you.
